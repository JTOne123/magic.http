# Magic HTTP for .Net

[![Build status](https://travis-ci.org/polterguy/magic.http.svg?master)](https://travis-ci.org/polterguy/magic.http)

A minimalistic HTTP REST library for .Net built for .Net Standard. The whole idea with the library, is to provide a
single line invocation for HTTP REST invocations from C# and other CLR languages. Below you can see an example of usage.

```csharp
var result = await client.GetAsync<Blog[]>("https://my-json-server.typicode.com/typicode/demo/posts");
```

The idea is that you provide your request type (if any), and your response type as generic arguments to its
`IHttpClient` interface, and the library will perform automatic conversion on your behalf, reducing your
HTTP REST invocations to a single line of code, resembling _"normal method invocations"_.

The library supports all 4 most commonly verbs, below is a list.

* POST
* GET
* PUT
* DELETE

The `POST` and `PUT` verbs requires payload objects, that you provide as typed generic arguments, while the `DELETE` and `GET`
verbs does not. In addition you can optionally supply a _"token"_, normally a JWT token, that will be transmitted in the
HTTP Authorize header of your request, as a _"Bearer"_ token. In addition the library will _"intelligently"_ handle both `Stream`
requests and `Stream` responses for POST, PUT and GET (not DELETE), allowing you to either supply a `Stream` as a request
object, which will serialize your stream directly on to the HTTP request stream, or by using the overload of the `GetAsync`
method that requires you to supply an `Action` taking one stream, from where you can directly access the HTTP response stream.
This allows you to serialize large files, without first loading them into memory, both as request payloads and as response
return values.

Apart from the above features, the library does not really give you much options, and is to be considered an _"opinionated"_
HTTP REST library, and its purpose is not to support every possible configuration you can imagine, since its purpose
is first and foremost to be dead simple. However, if you have that _"one feature request you simply must have"_, feel free
to supply a request in the [issues](https://github.com/polterguy/magic.http/issues).

## Dependency injection

The library is created to be _"dependency injection friendly"_, which implies you can use its `IHttpClient` interface
for accessing its functionality, using something such as the following to wire up your interface to its implementation,
for then to retrieve instances to its implementation using dependency injection later in your own code.

```code
services.AddTransient<IHttpClient, HttpClient>();
```

Most methods in its `HttpClient` implementation class is also virtual, allowing you to extend it, by inheriting from
its base class, and override whatever method you simply must change for some reasons. Since the library only supports
JSON and plain text Content-Type negotiation by default, unless you download large files, at which point you can set
your own Accept HTTP header - Overriding its base methods in your own derived implementation class might be useful for
edge cases, where you for some reasons simply must have support for something the library does not natively support.

However, the library is first and foremost created to support JSON and/or large files as payloads and response values,
and the _"philosophy"_ of the library is to allow you to create any HTTP REST requests with a single line of code, to
such facilitate for simplified code, and great cohesion in your own code. The library will not support every single
permutation of HTTP requests possible to create, due to that this would complicate its code, and result in that it over
time degradates.
